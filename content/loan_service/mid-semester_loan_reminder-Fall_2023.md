# Laptop Loan Reminder

Dear Students,

I hope this email finds you well and that you are having a successful semester thus far. As we approach the middle of the semester, it's essential to remind you of your responsibilities regarding the laptop loan you received from the Computing Program Laptop Loan Service.

## Responsibilities:

1. The laptop loan period remains in effect until the conclusion of the current semester's exam week, Friday, December 22, 2023.

2. Before the specified deadline, you must return the laptop in its original condition.

3. Failure to meet the return deadline or returning items in a damaged state will result in a fine ranging from $300 to $2,500, depending on the laptop model and mouse type.

4. Non-payment of the fine may lead to a business hold being placed on your student account.

5. If you encounter any technical difficulties with the laptop, promptly inform a classroom Assistant.

6. In the case of a damaged laptop or mouse, please email me immediately to arrange the return.

7. If you plan to travel abroad or withdraw from the program, email me to schedule the return date.

8. Ensure that all coursework stored on the laptop is backed up in the cloud using your personal GitHub account, UNH OneDrive, or other cloud services.

9. After Thanksgiving Holiday, you'll receive an email with information about scheduling the return of the loaned laptop and mouse.

Thank you for your cooperation and for helping us maintain the Computing Program Laptop Loan Service effectively.

Best regards,
