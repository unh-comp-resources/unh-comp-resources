title: "Final Reminder Email"
---

Dear Students,

I trust this message finds you well and engaged in your studies. As we approach the conclusion of the semester, it is crucial to remind you about the impending deadline of December 22, 2023, for returning the laptops you borrowed through the Computing Program Laptop Loan Service.

It is important that you schedule an appointment to return your laptop by **Today (December 1, 2023)**. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of your loan.

For loan responsibilities, please review the details provided in the email below.

Thank you for your cooperation and for helping us maintain the Computing Program Laptop Loan Service effectively.

Best regards,
