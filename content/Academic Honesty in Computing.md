title: Academic Honesty in Computing
---

## Overview

You will find here information about academic honesty guidelines in programming subjects. The goal is to help you understand when you can reuse code and how to collaborate with others on programming homework and projects.

**What are example of academic dishonesty in programming assignments?**

In individual programming assignments and projects, you need to develop your code on your own. Examples of academic dishonesty include the following:
- Having someone write the code for you.
- Copying or downloading someone else's code.
- Having someone walk you through their solution in detail and explain how to code it.
- Having someone else perform significant debugging of your code.
- Referring to solutions from previous semesters unless permitted by the instructor.
- Allowing others to copy or access your code.

You shall not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, give your code to another student who asks you for it. You shall not discuss the detailed algorithmic strategies that you and your collaborators end up turning in essentially the same code. Discuss at very high-level approaches together, but work on the coding on your own.

**What code can I reuse?**

However, you donâ€™t need to always write your code from scratch. The code you may reuse typically are:
- Any code you develop with the instructor, TAs, or class tutors.
- Code from the class slides and the class coding examples.
- Materials from the internet should only for educational purposes. If you write some code after you look at some code examples online, you need to include a proper acknowledgment to indicate the source.
- You may share additional test cases and expected results of test cases. Note that you should not share the solution code or experiment code.


**How to collaborate with my classmates?**

You are encouraged to study together, to discuss at a very high-level method for solving the assignments, to help each other in using the software, and to discuss methods for debugging code. Examples of allowable collaboration include discussions and debate of general concepts and solution strategies and help with certain syntax errors.

You are also allowed to post short segments of code (10 lines or less) of code that are giving you errors to the class public discussion board to get help on fixing the syntax error. You should not look at someone else code (current students, past students, and code from the web) or discuss the code in at such a detailed level that solutions turn out essentially the same.
