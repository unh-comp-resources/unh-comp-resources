## Loaned equipment return policy

These requirements pertain to students who have chosen remote learning and do not come to campus:
1. The student who wants to pick up/return AES loaned equipment needs to get their **COVID** self-test kits. They would need to swab and drop off in the outside receptacle at least 5 days prior to when they plan to come into the building. ​OR
2. The student who wants to pick up/return AES loaned equipment needs to meet one of the AES tech consultants outside of the building for the exchange. Please email any one of the tech consultants for an appointment.


**Note​**: Loaning equipment is only for students who live locally. If a student has already loaned equipment and plans to travel internationally or to other states outside New England, they need to return the equipment.
