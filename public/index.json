    "content": "Overview You will find here information about academic honesty guidelines in programming subjects. The goal is to help you understand when you can reuse code and how to collaborate with others on programming homework and projects.\nWhat are example of academic dishonesty in programming assignments?\nIn individual programming assignments and projects, you need to develop your code on your own. Examples of academic dishonesty include the following:\nHaving someone write the code for you. Copying or downloading someone else’s code. Having someone walk you through their solution in detail and explain how to code it. Having someone else perform significant debugging of your code. Referring to solutions from previous semesters unless permitted by the instructor. Allowing others to copy or access your code. You shall not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, give your code to another student who asks you for it. You shall not discuss the detailed algorithmic strategies that you and your collaborators end up turning in essentially the same code. Discuss at very high-level approaches together, but work on the coding on your own.\nWhat code can I reuse?\nHowever, you don’t need to always write your code from scratch. The code you may reuse typically are:\nAny code you develop with the instructor, TAs, or class tutors. Code from the class slides and the class coding examples. Materials from the internet should only for educational purposes. If you write some code after you look at some code examples online, you need to include a proper acknowledgment to indicate the source. You may share additional test cases and expected results of test cases. Note that you should not share the solution code or experiment code. How to collaborate with my classmates?\nYou are encouraged to study together, to discuss at a very high-level method for solving the assignments, to help each other in using the software, and to discuss methods for debugging code. Examples of allowable collaboration include discussions and debate of general concepts and solution strategies and help with certain syntax errors.\nYou are also allowed to post short segments of code (10 lines or less) of code that are giving you errors to the class public discussion board to get help on fixing the syntax error. You should not look at someone else code (current students, past students, and code from the web) or discuss the code in at such a detailed level that solutions turn out essentially the same.\n",

Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.\nWhy Docker? Consistency: Docker ensures consistency across environments, from development to production. Isolation: Containers isolate applications from the underlying infrastructure, ensuring that they run consistently regardless of where they are deployed. Efficiency: Docker enables lightweight and portable containers, optimizing resource utilization and speeding up the development process. Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by adding or removing container instances as needed. Getting Started with Docker Installation To get started with Docker, you’ll need to install Docker Engine on your local machine. You can find installation instructions for various operating systems on the official Docker website.\nDocker Basics Docker Images A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. You can pull existing images from Docker Hub or create your own custom images using Dockerfiles.\nDocker Containers A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, ensuring that applications run consistently regardless of the environment.\nDocker Compose Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define a multi-container application in a single YAML file and use a single command to start, stop, and manage the entire application stack.\nDocker Commands Basic Commands docker pull \u003cimage\u003e: Pull an image from a registry. docker run \u003cimage\u003e: Run a container based on an image. docker ps: List running containers. docker stop \u003ccontainer\u003e: Stop a running container. Advanced Commands docker build \u003cpath/to/Dockerfile\u003e: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile. docker-compose up: Start a multi-container application defined in a Docker Compose file. docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e \u003ccommand\u003e: Execute a command inside a running container.

Password-based authentication for Git is deprecated, and using a PAT is more secure. For more information, see \"Creating a personal access token.\"\nYou can avoid being prompted for your password caching your GitHub credentials in Git (see next guidelines below). Once you've configured credential caching, Git automatically uses your cached personal access token when you pull or push a repository using HTTPS.\nCaching your GitHub credentials in Git If you are cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GiHub credentials.\nSee https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git and choose the operating system of your machine: Mac, Windows, or Linux.\nWe consider below the example of Linux or Linux Subsystem in Window 10.\nSet git to use the memory cache with help from credential.helper. Otherwise, by default, Git caches the password for 15 minutes. $ git config –global credential.helper cache\nTo change the default password cache timeout to 1 hour: $ git config –global credential.helper 'cache –timeout=3600'\nCaching timeout to neve To change the default password cache timeout to never, the setting is operating system dependent.\nOn Mac OSX: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain On Windows: First you must install git credential manager for Windows [microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows: Secure Git credential storage for Windows with support for Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub, and Bitbucket multi-factor authentication.] For git 2.7.3+ now run: git config --global credential.helper manager On any Linux gnome-keyring is needed: Fedora: sudo dnf install git-credential-libsecret git config --global credential.helper /usr/libexec/git-core/git-credential-libsecret Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev cd /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret sudo make git config –global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret Creating a personal access token (PAT) You should create a personal access token to use in place of a password with the command line or with the GitHub API.\nSee https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token to learn how to create a PAT.\nOnce you have a token, you can enter the token instead of your password when performing Git operations over HTTPS. For example:\n$ git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git\nUsername: your_username\nPassword: your_token\nIf you are not prompted for your username and password, your credentials may be cached on your computer. You need to update your credentials in the Keychain to replace your old password with the token.\nInstead of manually entering your PAT for every HTTPS Git operation (push, fetch, pull, or clone), you can cache your PAT in Git. Git will temporarily store your credentials in memory until an expiry interval has passed. You can also store the token in a plain text file that Git can read before every request. For more information, see Caching your GitHub credentials in Git.\nEnabling 2FA on github.\nEnabling 2FA allows you to secure your github account via phone. In the coming months, password only authentication will be phased out, and every github user will be forced to use 2FA. Because of this it's better to get it set up, and to get used to the workflow changes it brings now.\nBy following the guide linked below, you can walk yourself through getting 2FA set up on github.\ndraft-resources/github2FA.md at main · unh-aes-resources/draft-resources\nReferences GitHub Documentation.

Virtual Environments keep dependencies separated by project and because of that, they allow you to use different versions of Python or third-party libraries in each project you work on.\nWhat is Jekyll and why use Jekyll? GitHub Pages are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories,that are freely hosted on GitHub’s github.io domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes,so they are a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free. Jekyll is a Ruby Gem, Jekyll is written in Ruby, it is a static site generator. For Example, you write your content in the text editor and it gets converted into a website using Jekyll. So, no prior CSS knowledge is required, just focus on the content.\nAdvantages of using Jekyll:\nSimplicity: You use Markdown its efficient and easy and beautiful. Speed: Pages are pre-rendered html pages, so no requests going back and forth for you, just html pages, which makes it very fast Secure: While only html pages make you site loads really fast, it’s also really secure, as there is no php code to look for error to or something that a hacker could use and there is even no database to hack in the first place! What is a Ruby Gem? A Ruby gem is a package of code, configured so that it complies with the Ruby style of software distribution. There are many Gems available, covering a large range of useful packages. Gems can be downloaded manually and added to the Gem file of your app, or you can use the Bundler tool to do that for you. For understanding, think of it as a plugin or code already made for you to use. Imagine you need to build a login form in your website, there is already some code existing in a file (gem), we must replace the content with the content we need. For this, we can create our own gems or use the ones already existing. You can find the list of gems in (https://rubygems.org/) website.\nRuby virtual environment A local, mutable, deployment directory for the execution environment that is independent of the global (system) environment. With Ruby, this is accomplished with the rbenv utility and these rbenv plugins: rbenv-gem-rehash, rbenv-gemset, ruby-build. RVM and rbenv? Both RVM and rbenv are Ruby version management tool. RVM is used to manage and install different versions of Ruby and gemsets on system where Rbenv is a lightweight Ruby version management tool. The best way to install and manage multiple side-by-side installations of Ruby is to use the Ruby virtual environment manager rbenv.\nActivating the Ruby virtual environment Switching an execution context to use the local deployment directory preferentially ahead of the global environment or masking the global environment. With Ruby virtual environments, this is accomplished using the rbenv local command to set a .ruby-version file in the project root folder, and a .ruby-gemsets file in the project root directing the location of gems to a .gems file, also in the project root.\nNote : Unlike python virtual environment activation this does not change the prompt to indicate the Ruby Virtual environment is active.\nVirtual environment deactivation mechanism For standing down a virtual environment i.e., for switching the execution context back to using the global environment and ignoring the deployment directory. This is accomplished using the rbenv local –unset command, which removes the. ruby-version file in the project root.\nNote : This doesn’t fully deactivate the virtual environment. If the working directory is within the project or application directory tree, then the .rbenv-gemsets file will still affect any gem install command.\nwhat is a Bundler? With rbenv-gemsets keeping gem installations within the project tree, there still needs to be a way to declare the gems required by the project and the gem versions required. Bundler uses a text file called Gemfile to control which gems, and which versions, get installed for a project—much in the same way that a requirements.txt file controls Python packages with pip in a Python virtual environment. Firstly, Bundler needs to be installed to use it. You can either install it in a project specific gemset, or you can install it into the Ruby installation directory. GitHub pages Setup on Ubuntu 1.

    "content": "Overview Pipenv is a packaging tool for Python that solves some common problems associated with the typical workflow using pip, virtualenv, and the good old requirements.txt.\nIn addition to addressing some common issues, it consolidates and simplifies the development process to a single command line tool.\nProblems that Pipenv solves Let’s say we’ve got a requirements.txt file that looks something like this:\nPython Requirements\rpackage_a\rpackage_bLet’s say package_a has a sub-dependency package_c, and package_a requires a specific version of this package: package_c\u003e=1.0. In turn, package_b has the same sub-dependency but needs package_c\u003c=2.0.\nIdeally, when we try to install package_a and package_b, the installation tool would look at the requirements for package_c (being \u003e=1.0 and \u003c=2.0) and select a version that fulfills those requirements. we would hope that the tool resolves the dependencies so that our program works in the end.\nUnfortunately, pip itself doesn’t have real dependency resolution at the moment, but there’s an open issue to support it.\nThe way pip would handle the above scenario is as follows:\nIt installs package_a and looks for a version of package_c that fulfills the first requirement (package_c\u003e=1.0).\nPip then installs the latest version of package_c to fulfill that requirement. Let’s say the latest version of package_c is 3.1. And This is where the trouble starts. If the version of package_c selected by pip doesn’t fit future requirements (such as package_b needing package_c\u003c=2.0), the installation will fail.\nThe “solution” to this problem is to specify the range required for the sub-dependency (package_c) in the requirements.txt file. That way, pip can resolve this conflict and install a package that meets those requirements:\nPython Requirements\rpackage_c\u003e=1.0,\u003c=2.0\rpackage_a\rpackage_bThe issue with this is that if package_a changes their requirement without you knowing, the requirements you specified (package_c\u003e=1.0,\u003c=2.0) may no longer be acceptable, and installation may fail… again. The real problem is that once again, we’re responsible for staying up to date with requirements of sub-dependencies.\nIdeally, installation tool would be smart enough to install packages that meet all the requirements without explicitly specifying sub-dependency versions.\nPipenv Installation Installation using pip\npip install pipenvIf you’re on MacOS, you can install Pipenv easily with Homebrew. You can also use Linuxbrew on Linux using the command:\nbrew install pipenvOr, if you’re using Fedora 28:\nsudo dnf install pipenvTo upgrade pipenv at any time:\npip install --user --upgrade pipenvCrude Installation of Pipenv\nIf you don’t even have pip installed, you can use this crude installation method, which will bootstrap your whole system:\n$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/pipenv/master/get-pipenv.py | pythonwe can create a new pipenv project in our project directory with\npipenv --python $PYTHON_VERSIONwhich will initialize the project using the specified Python version (if pyenv is installed, it can even install Python versions on-demand). To start with, this creates:\na Pipfile config file at the project home specifying Python version, sources, and any installed packages a fresh virtual environment housed in the pipenv working directory We no longer have to manage installs with pip and virtual environments separately - pipenv takes care of both! To install a package, simply running\npipenv install PACKAGE_NAMEwill both install the package into the virtual environment, and write the package as a dependency into the Pipfile. This Pipfile is then all we need to rebuild the project elsewhere, rather than the requirements.txt used by other managers - simply running pipenv install on a directory with a Pipfile will recreate the environment. To activate the environment,\npipenv shellwill launch a new shell process using the project’s virtual environment. Next, pipenv can do something fairly unique - it fully determines and specifies dependencies for the project. At the minimum, pip install just needs a package name to install, e.g. pip install numpy. We can, of course, specify version limits, e.g. numpy==1.18.1, in pip install or requirements files. However, beyond this, pip doesn’t really do much validation - while pulling required dependencies of the packages we want to install, pip can potentially end up pulling clashing versions, so unless we’ve actually checked that everything installs (like by actually installing everything and then generating the requirements file directly from pip freeze) we can run into issues trying to rebuild the environment from the package requirements. Instead, pipenv exhaustively builds out the dependency graph, flagging any issues and generating a validated Pipfile.lock for fully specifying every dependency in the project. We can trigger this manually for the requirements in our Pipfile with\npipenv lockto pull the specifically requested packages from the Pipfile and generate the dependency graph for Pipfile.lock. While this does produce environments that can be deterministically reproduced, the dependency resolution can be quite complex, so pipenv environments are slower to write than using bare pip.\nPros: officially supported by Python Packaging Authority single tool for project, virtual environment, and package management plays well with pyenv and conda for Python \u0026 environment types validated, deterministic dependencies for every project Cons: incompatible with other management tools, so requires consistent use across projects and users dependency resolution is quite slow ",

    "content": "Need for virtual environments Python, like most other modern programming languages, has its own unique way of downloading, storing, and resolving packages (or modules). While this has its advantages, there were some interesting decisions made about package storage and resolution, which has lead to some problems particularly with how and where packages are stored.\nIt’s important to know this because, by default, every project on your system will use these same directories to store and retrieve site packages (third party libraries). At first glance, this may not seem like a big deal, and it isn’t really, for system packages (packages that are part of the standard Python library), but it does matter for site packages.\nConsider the following scenario where you have two projects: ProjectA and ProjectB, both of which have a dependency on the same library, ProjectC. The problem becomes apparent when we start requiring different versions of ProjectC. Maybe ProjectA needs v1.0.0, while ProjectB requires the newer v2.0.0, for example.\nThis is a real problem for Python since it can’t differentiate between versions in the site-packages directory. Since projects are stored according to just their name, there is no differentiation between versions. Thus, both projects, ProjectA and ProjectB, would be required to use the same version, which is unacceptable in many cases.\nThis is where virtual environments come into play…\nWhat is a virtual environment in Python? At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.\nIn our little example above, we’d just need to create a separate virtual environment for both ProjectA and ProjectB, and we’d be good to go. Each environment, in turn, would be able to depend on whatever version of ProjectC they choose, independent of the other.\nThe great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since they’re just directories containing a few scripts. Plus, they’re easily created using the pipenv or conda tools.\n",
